## :mortar_board: Education 
**MSc Data Science & Society** at Tilburg University _(Jan 2021 - Present)_ <br>
I am currently working on my MSc with a special interest in Machine Learning and Time-series analysis
<br>
<br>
**BSc Economics & Business Economics** at Utrecht University  _(Aug 2018 - Jan 2021)_ <br>
I obtained my BSc with an average grade of 7.4. <br>

I wrote my thesis on the effect of local social networks and the use of media on the success rate of Kickstarter projects
<br>
   
**Unfinished BA Liberal Arts and Sciences** _(Jan 2016 - Aug 2018)_ <br>
I started my BA at University College Roosevelt, which is a separate faculty of Utrecht University located in Middelburg.<br>
My major was a combination economics, ecology and human geography.<br>
After realizing that I was mostly interested in economics and modeling, I decided to switch to Economics full-time
<br>

## :computer: Technical Skills
**Machine Learning** <br>
All my machine learning projects are done using Python using modules like Numpy, Pandas and Scipy<br>
I am proficient with Sklearn for all preprocessing and unsupervised machine learning <br>
For supervised learning I mostly use Keras and Tensorflow instead of Pytorch<br>


**Python** <br>
Besides using Python for machine learning, I have worked with Django for basic web app design and GeoPandas for geospatial analysis<br>

**R** <br>
I use R mostly for statistical analysis, but also for time-series analysis  <br>
I have extensive experience with time-series analysis methods such as fractal analysis, change point detection, empirical dynamic modeling etc. 
<br>
I am proficient at using R for machine learning purposes such as logistic regression or KNN, but generally use Python for this purpose
<br>
<br>
**Miscellaneous** <br>
I enjoy making personal projects that teach me something about other programming languages. <br>
Because of this, I have some experience with Javascript, Node JS, Raspberry Pi and Haskell.
<br>
<br>
## :office: Work
**Exam Training at Lyceo** _(Jan 2021 - Present)_ <br>
Next to my studies I provide students with a two-day training course in preparation for their final high-school exams <br>
I believe that having some didactic skills makes me better at explaining my way of thinking and therefore a better collaborator in general<br>

## :pushpin: Extra-curricular Activities
**Commission Affairs Officer at Rooseveltâ€™s All Student Association** <br>
I did a board year at University College Roosevelt's main student association.<br> 
In this function I was responsible for one third of the commissions and societies at the association along with general board tasks.<br>
This was in the form of about 15 hours of work per week next to my regular studies.<br>
